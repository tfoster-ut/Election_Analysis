# Election Audit

## **Overview of Election Audit**

The purpose of the election audit was to identify the winner of the election based on the votes cast.  In addition to knowing the winner of the election, we were also tasked with looking into the vote counts and the percentage of votes by county and candidate.

## **Election_Audit Summary**

The script was written to determine these election results which can be used throughout the rest of the state and in other elections with great accuracy and speed.  Other uses of this script in its current state and with slight modifications include:

  1. This script with a slight addition to the existing code could identify duplicate instances of Ballot IDs.  This analysis can help us identify instances of          potential voter fraud or erroneous duplicate entries that could cause the election to be inaccurate.
  2. With a few more substantial changes and additional data within the source file, the existing script could help determine other voter dynamics such as age          groups, race, gender, etc.  These additional insights would help to provide further context as to the groupings that voted for specific candidates.
